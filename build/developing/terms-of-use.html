                    Our Company uses the terms ‘Warranty’ and ‘Extended Warranty’ with ‘Vehicle Service
                    Contract’ and ‘Extended Service Contract’ for marketing purposes only. * A Vehicle
                    Service Contract (VSC) is often referred to as an "auto warranty" or an "extended
                    car warranty," but it is not a warranty. A VSC does, however, provide repair coverage
                    for your vehicle after the manufacturer’s car warranty expires. A VSC is a contract
                    between you and a VSC provider or administrator that states what a covered repair
                    is and what is not.
